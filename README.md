# Sample of Projects:


## Classification
#### [Will people comprehend the news as a Bulish or not?](https://github.com/yasi44/Classifier_BulishPredictor_NLPCryptoNews_Prices)
![Alt text](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.zU3UWFU3dREt9TXVHJmwOAHaEK&pid=Api&P=0&h=180)
- This predictor can help to know how people will comprehend a news, before publishing that news. Thus, a market movement from people reaction may be partially predicted. Here a classifier model, trained on the data created from combination of news and price, and all the features engineered and extracted. Given a news, this classifier determines if a news will be comprehend from readers as a Bulish news or not.
- Data: Text and Price
- Algorithm: RandomForestClassifier
